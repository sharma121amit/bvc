    Abhoy Charonarobindo Bhoktibedanto Swamy Probhupad; Sanskrit: अभय चरणारविन्द भक्तिवेदान्त स्वामी प्रभुपाद, IAST: abhaya-caraṇāravinda
    bhakti-vedānta svāmī prabhupāda; 1 September 1896 – 14 November 1977) was a Gaudiya Vaishnava spiritual teacher (guru)
    and the founder preceptor (acharya) of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness[1] (ISKCON), commonly known
    as the "Hare Krishna Movement".[2] His mission was to propagate Gaudiya Vaishnavism, a school of Vaishnavite Hinduism that
    had been taught to him by his guru, Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati, throughout the world.[3] Born Abhay Charan De in Calcutta, 
    he was educated at the prestigious local Scottish Church College.[4] Before adopting the life of a pious renunciant (vanaprastha)
    in 1950,[5] he was married with children and owned a small pharmaceutical business.[6][7]
